# ECG
This project implements several deep learning architectures to classify ECG signals using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Transformers, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with attention mechanism. The model is designed to handle 12-lead ECG signals and make binary predictions.
